<h1>Pistachio Macaron</h1>
<p>If you are a <em>nut-cuisine-savvy gourmet</em>, you probably noticed that industrial pistachio flavour tastes very different than actual pistachio. </p><p>And yet, <strong>pistachio nuts shelter a pure, delicate taste, that needs preserving as much as possible</strong>, until it lands in your hands. Therefore, as you bite into our pistachio macaron, you will feel the pistachio nut bits not only delicately set on top of the macaron, but also inside the ganache itself.</p>
